# TaskTracker
I am learning python in roadmap.sh currently. This is the first project, and I'm so excited.
You can see the initial requirements and other ppl's solution at https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker.
and I will expand this application for further use but i have not thought of any of it, still.
